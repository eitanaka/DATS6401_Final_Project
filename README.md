# DATS6401_Final_Project

This repository contains Python code for visualizing complex data using various libraries and techniques. The code focuses on analyzing and visualizing store sales time series data. The main goal is to provide insights and create interactive visualizations to understand sales trends and patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be obtained from the following Kaggle competition link:
[Store Sales time series forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data)

## Getting Started
To run the code, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system
- Install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

2. Download the datasets:
- Download the "train.csv" and "stores.csv" files from the Kaggle competition link mentioned above.

3. Update the URLs:
- Open the Python script "visualization_code.py" in a text editor.
- Replace the values of the variables `url1` and `url2` with the local file paths of the downloaded datasets.

### Running the Code
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
3. Run the following command to execute the script:

### Interpreting the Results
- The code will perform various data preprocessing steps, conduct statistical analysis, and generate static and interactive visualizations.
- The results will be displayed in the console and graphical windows, depending on the visualization techniques used.

## Interactive Dashboard
The code also includes the creation of an interactive dashboard using Dash.
- After running the code, open a web browser and go to the provided local server address (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050/).
- The dashboard will allow you to explore different tabs, range sliders, drop-down menus, input fields, and graphs.

## Dependencies
The code utilizes the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- dash
